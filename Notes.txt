1. Express is build on top HTTP module, through .listen() port binding happens and 
through const app = express() an HTML instance server is created...
2.Server registers itself with Nodejs event loop,it handles incoming requests then,
as Nodejs is event driven...
3.When an HTTP server is hit with the request, it parses it and then passes it to
the express app, as app is just a request handler...

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server running on http://localhost:3000');
});

// const app = require('express');
// Equivalent to:
// const http = require('http');
// const server = http.createServer(app);
// server.listen(3000);

// A react element - Actual representation of the UI...
// DOM element - Browser specific or platform specific representation of the react element...
// Instance - Element's representation of the Virtual DOM...    

// proxy:{'/api':'http://localhost:3000}
// Wherever you see /api, append it with the link and also now server and frontend would be 
// on the same port...
